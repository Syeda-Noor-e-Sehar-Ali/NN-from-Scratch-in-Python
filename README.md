# NN-from-Scratch-in-Python
Building a Neural Network (NN) from scratch in Python involves constructing the fundamental components of a feedforward neural network:

Begin by initializing the network's parameters, including weights and biases, which are typically initialized randomly or with specific heuristics. Define the architecture, specifying the number of layers, neurons per layer, and activation functions like sigmoid or ReLU for each neuron.

Implement the forward propagation algorithm to compute predictions for given input data, passing activations through each layer and applying the chosen activation function. Then, calculate the loss using a suitable loss function such as mean squared error or cross-entropy, comparing predicted outputs with actual targets.

Next, implement backpropagation to compute gradients of the loss function with respect to network parameters, facilitating weight updates through gradient descent or its variants. Iterate through multiple epochs, repeating forward and backward passes to refine parameter values and minimize the loss.

Finally, evaluate the trained neural network on test data to assess its performance metrics such as accuracy or mean squared error, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data. Building an NN from scratch in Python provides foundational understanding of neural network operations and their application in various machine learning tasks.
